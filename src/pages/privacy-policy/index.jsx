                  Furniture and appliances are often the first
                  things you think of when you think about downsizing. But if your
                  <br />
                  tiny house is built with a loft space, it will
                  give you plenty of room to store these items more efficiently. This
                  <br />
                  means that while your furniture might be smaller,
                  it does not have to take up as much space as before.

                <p className="color-grey font-14">
                  Plus, using more multi-purpose furniture can make
                  your living quarters feel even more spacious. This cuts
                  <br />
                  down the furniture and appliances expense to a
                  great extent and adds to your small house saving.
